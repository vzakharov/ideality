            Outline

            1. The AI industry is booming, but the hardware that powers it is
            not.

            2. The industry is effectively monopolized by a few big players, who
            enjoy economies of scale and captive supply chains.

            3. This is a problem for many chipmakers, who can’t make money off
            the hardware they themselves produce.

            4. How can this situation be improved?

            A. By addressing the entry barriers with respect to the DLA market.

            B. By adopting IP core solutions that enable easy integration into
            silicon.

            C. By lowering the cost of DLA solutions through innovation rather
            than quality deterioration.

            5. A look into the future: What will democratizing AI hardware mean
            for the industry — and the world?
