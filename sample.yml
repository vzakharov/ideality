       well-established technology companies, most notably IBM, Intel, Nvidia, Microsoft. Smaller firms are working on AI-based products as well.

      Thus far there is no dominant AI platform with hundreds of thousands of

      newer players. But the future of AI is more than just a battle of giants:
      It's about harnessing technology to make life easier and better for us
      all.


      The most disruptive use cases involve combining what we know about each
      other with data from our surroundings—the way that automated car
      navigation systems, for example, can combine information from your phone's

      The small, agile startups that are leading the AI market today dominate
      this sphere through sheer energy, guts and determination. They take
      advantage of existing platforms for their products such as Amazon's Alexa
      and Google's speech recognition software, which they develop in-house.
      This makes them faster than their competitors and superior in quality.
